### Proposal Highlights
- Market rate: $10,000-$15,000
- Client price: $1,800 (85% discount)
- Timeline: 3 weeks
- ROI: 2-3 weeks
- Support: 14 days post-launch
- Validity: 10 days

## Technical Environment
- Working directory: `/Users/chris_mac_air/work/elevatedGent/elevated-gentleman-app`
- Running on: http://localhost:3001
- Platform: macOS Darwin
- Node/NPM: Active
- Git: Initialized, pushing to GitHub repo

## Key Decisions & Rationale

### Why $1,800 for CMS:
- Student budget constraints
- Portfolio building value
- Long-term relationship potential
- Existing codebase knowledge
- Achievable in 30-40 hours ($45-60/hour effective)

### Scope Reductions:
- Analytics removed (saves 8-10 hours)
- Support reduced to 14 days (from 30)
- No email marketing features
- Simplified user roles

### Future Relationship Strategy:
- Document this as "student discount"
- Set expectations for market-rate future work
- Position for recurring maintenance ($99-199/month)
- Identify upsell opportunities post-launch

## Next Actions

### Immediate:
1. Send CMS proposal to client
2. Follow up within 2-3 days
3. Prepare CMS development environment

### Upon Approval:
1. Set up admin routes in Next.js
2. Create database schema for CMS
3. Implement authentication for admin
4. Build CRUD operations for content

### Future Opportunities:
1. Analytics dashboard ($600)
2. Email marketing ($600)
3. Subscription box system ($3,000)
4. AI recommendations ($2,500)
5. Mobile app ($5,000+)
